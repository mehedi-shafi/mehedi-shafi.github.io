      It’s a fun game playing bots that takes a screenshot of the word‑scrabble game and finds possible moves based on available letters, extracted using Tesseract OCR. All possible correct words with the extracted characters are sorted by the length in descending order as sequential moves. It can score 3x more than a human player within 60s time limit of the game without being detected as a bot.
