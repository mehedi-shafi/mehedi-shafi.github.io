      An API that returns the number of solves during a given contest and after‑contest practice submissions for individual users. It uses CodeForce’s API to get contest‑wise submission data and generates user‑specific effort for that contest. It’s actively being used in Daffotil International University’s contest tracking system for contest programmers. Everyday it serves at least 50 active contest programmers to track their progress.
