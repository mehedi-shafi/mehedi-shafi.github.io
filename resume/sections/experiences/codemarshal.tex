        \item {Worked on an API that uses Tesseract and Tensorflow to extract textual data from received identification cards and validate using 3rd party API. This is a part of the e‑KYC system.}
        \item {Architected an API to run face verification. Initially, it was using DLIB then moved to use YOLO‑v3, and finally moved to Retinaface. The final service runs on Apache MXNET model‑server and the previous ones on Flask.}
        \item {Improved performance of android SDK capable of running face detection and verification real‑time and offline using TFLite by over 200\% by optimizing the model and vectorizing image operations. Later nid‑detection was added to the SDK.}
